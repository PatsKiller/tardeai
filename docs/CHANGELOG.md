## 2026-06-09 — Schwab Phase 1 scope clarification (docs/git-log only; no behavior change)

> Phase 1 proves safety guards under simulated Schwab failures. It does not prove live Schwab
> connectivity. Live OAuth, real reads, account-hash mapping, true rate limits, token roll-forward
> behavior, and Schwab API payloads remain NOT_PROVEN pending Developer Portal credentials.

- Commit `23f17865` uses "(PROVEN)" in its title to mean the safety guards were proven under simulation.
  It does NOT indicate live Schwab connectivity. See this clarification and
  `docs/architecture/SCHWAB_API_PHASE1_READONLY_FOUNDATION.md`.
- Commit `2f19ffba` is the honest Phase-1 doc ("guards proven (simulated) / live NOT_PROVEN").
- No code, config, migration, test, schema, gate, or capability-flag change in this clarification. The
  token manager, protected holdings writer, adapter, guards, and every NOT_PROVEN stub remain
  byte-identical.
